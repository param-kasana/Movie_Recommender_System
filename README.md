# Movie Recommender System

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Movie Recommender System using various collaborative filtering techniques. Three main tasks are addressed, each involving different aspects of user-based and item-based collaborative filtering, and an exploration of a novel solution to enhance recommendation quality.

## Task 1: User-based Collaborative Filtering

### Objective
Develop, implement, and evaluate user-based collaborative filtering using KNN (k-nearest neighbour).

### Requirements
- Choose an appropriate similarity metric.
- Implement the approach in Python.
- Study the impact of parameter K with at least 5 different values.
- Use RMSE as the metric for evaluation.
- Summarize results and findings in slides and a presentation.

## Task 2: Item-based Collaborative Filtering

### Objective
Develop, implement, and evaluate item-based collaborative filtering using KNN.

### Requirements
- Choose an appropriate value for the parameter K.
- Implement the approach in Python.
- Compare the performance of at least 2 similarity metrics.
- Use RMSE as the metric for evaluation.
- Summarize results and findings in slides and a presentation.

## Task 3: A Better Recommender System

### Task 3.1: Identify/Propose a Better Solution

#### Objective
Identify/propose a solution to improve recommendation quality and evaluate its performance.

#### Requirements
- Search and read related publications on recommender systems.
- Choose a solution published in a peer-reviewed journal or conference.
- Implement the solution and compare it with two baseline methods.

### Task 3.2: Evaluate the Better Solution

#### Objective
Evaluate the performance of the proposed solution compared to baseline methods.

#### Requirements
- Randomly choose 5 users who have rated more than 100 movies each.
- Recommend Top-30 movies to each user.
- Use AP (Average Precision) and NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) as evaluation metrics.
- Compare the performance of three solutions: Movie Average, KNN-based Collaborative Filtering, and the proposed solution.


## Conclusion

This Movie Recommender System project explores various collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations. The implementation details and findings are summarized in presentation slides for each task.
